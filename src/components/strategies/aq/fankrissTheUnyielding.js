            <Tactic title='Mortal Wound' description="When the current tankâ€™s stacks of Mortal Wound get too high to heal through a new tank will move in front of Fankriss and taunt to take over, allowing the previous tank to retreat into the melee position and let their stacks fall off." />
            <Tactic title='Vekniss Hatchlings' description="Vekniss Hatchlings need to be AoE tanked to keep them off of healers. A Paladin tank is ideal for this as they can BoK spam to grab all the stray mobs, but they must be careful not to accidentally pull Fankriss as well. The tank will need to call for AoE to kill the bugs whenever their numbers are too high." />
            <Tactic title='Spawns of Fankriss' description="At least one tank with high mitigation gear should be assigned to the Spawns of Fankriss when they pop up as they can very easily one-shot healers if they are not controlled. DPS must prioritize the Spawns of Fankriss to kill them before they enrage. The spawns should also be stunned as often as possible to mitigate their high damage output." />
            <Tactic title='Heal Entangled Players' description="In addition to the tanks and raid healing, some healers should be assigned to heal Entangled players. These healers may need to move outside of the raid group to be close enough to heal Entangled targets." />
